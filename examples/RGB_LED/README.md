# RGB LED Example
This project is a simple example showing how to control an RGB LED using the ATSAMD21 family of microcontrollers. The assumption is that LEDs are connected to microcontroller pins such that current flows through the diode when the pin is pulled low, as in the following diagram.

Please note that the power and ground connections are simplified for brevity.

The pin assignments can be modified by changing the values assigned to LED_RED, LED_GREEN, etc in config_led.h
